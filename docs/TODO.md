# Implementation Plan for AutoCRM

## **Prerequisites (Already Completed)**

- Project template set up with stack, linting rules, logging system, CI/CD.
- Basic migration with Supabase initialized.

---

## **1. User Authentication Implementation**

### **1.1. Supabase Authentication Configuration**

- **[ ] Enable Authentication Providers:**
  - Configure Supabase to allow **Email/Password** sign-up and login.
  - Set up **Single Sign-On (SSO)** providers (e.g., Google, GitHub):
    - Obtain client IDs and secrets from each SSO provider.
    - Input credentials into Supabase Authentication settings.

- **[ ] Define User Roles and Permissions:**
  - Create a `user_profiles` table linked to `auth.users` via `user_id`.
  - Add a `role` column with possible values: `'customer'`, `'service_rep'`, `'admin'`.
  - Set default roles for new users.

- **[ ] Implement Row Level Security (RLS):**
  - Enable RLS on all relevant tables (`tickets`, `user_profiles`, etc.).
  - Write policies to restrict data access based on user roles:
    - Customers can access only their own tickets.
    - Service reps can access tickets assigned to them or unassigned tickets.
    - Admins have full access.

- **[ ] Set Up Edge Function API Auth Tokens:**
  - Ensure Edge Functions validate Supabase JWT tokens.
  - Extract user information and roles from tokens within Edge Functions.
  - Secure Edge Functions with proper authentication checks.

### **1.2. Frontend Authentication Implementation**

- **[ ] Install Supabase Client Library in Frontend:**
  - Use `@supabase/supabase-js` for authentication and database operations.

- **[ ] Build Authentication UI Components:**
  - **Login Page:**
    - Email/Password fields.
    - SSO Buttons for each provider.
    - Error handling and validation messages.
  - **Sign-Up Page:**
    - Registration form for new customers.
    - Option for service reps to register (or handled by admin).
  - **Password Reset Flow:**
    - Forgot Password link.
    - Password reset email and confirmation pages.
  - **Front Page Sample Account Buttons:**
    - **"Sign in as Customer"** button:
      - Logs in with a sample customer account.
    - **"Sign in as Service Rep"** button:
      - Logs in with a sample service rep account.

- **[ ] Implement Auth State Management:**
  - Use React Context or state management library (e.g., Redux) to manage auth state.
  - Listen for auth state changes using Supabase's `onAuthStateChange`.
  - Store session tokens securely (consider using `localStorage` or `secure HTTP-only cookies`).

- **[ ] Role-Based Routing and Access Control:**
  - Set up protected routes that check for authentication and user role.
  - Redirect users to appropriate dashboards after login based on role.
  - Show/hide navigation items and features based on user permissions.

- **[ ] Logout Functionality:**
  - Implement logout button that signs users out of Supabase.
  - Clear auth state and redirect to the login or home page.

### **1.3. Database Migrations and Schema Updates**

- **[ ] Update Database Schema:**
  - **`user_profiles` Table:**
    - `id`: Primary Key.
    - `user_id`: UUID, references `auth.users`.
    - `full_name`: Text.
    - `email`: Text (unique).
    - `role`: Text (enum of `'customer'`, `'service_rep'`, `'admin'`).
    - Additional fields as needed.

- **[ ] Run Migrations:**
  - Use Supabase CLI or SQL scripts to apply schema changes.
  - Verify that tables and columns are correctly created.

- **[ ] Seed Sample Data:**
  - Create sample accounts for:
    - Sample Customer.
    - Sample Customer Service Rep.
  - Assign appropriate roles and link to `user_profiles`.
