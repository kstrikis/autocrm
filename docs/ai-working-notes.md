## Authentication Implementation (2024-01-20)

### Initial Changes Made
1. Fixed import paths:
   - Changed relative imports to use `@/` alias
   - Moved `useToast` import from `@/components/ui/use-toast` to `@/hooks/use-toast`

2. Added TypeScript return types:
   - Added `Promise<void>` to async functions
   - Added `React.ReactElement` to component returns
   - Added `void` return types to callbacks

3. Fixed floating promises:
   - Added `void` operator to `navigate()` calls
   - Added `void` to `supabase.auth.getSession()`

4. Added logging:
   - Added missing `methodEntry` and `methodExit` calls
   - Added logging to AuthProvider component
   - Fixed LandingPage logging

5. Implemented sample login functionality:
   - Updated `handleSampleLogin` to actually use the `signIn` function
   - Added proper error handling and logging

### Authentication System Design

#### Authentication Flow
- Using Supabase Auth (built on GoTrue authentication service)
- Flow: `User Input → Supabase Auth API → JWT Token → Supabase Database`
- Signup process:
  1. Credentials sent to Supabase Auth
  2. New user created in `auth.users` table
  3. JWT generated and returned
  4. RLS policies use JWT for database access control

#### Data Persistence
- User data stored in:
  1. `auth.users` table (Supabase-managed)
  2. `user_profiles` table (custom)
- JWT stored in browser's localStorage
- Auto-login flow:
  1. Supabase client checks localStorage for JWT
  2. Validates token with Supabase Auth
  3. Auto-logs in if valid

#### Demo Accounts Implementation
- Requirements:
  1. Seed data in `auth.users` (Supabase)
  2. Matching entries in `user_profiles`
  3. Pre-defined roles and permissions
- Seed data structure:
  ```sql
  -- seed.sql
  INSERT INTO auth.users (email, encrypted_password, role) VALUES
  ('customer@example.com', 'hashed_password', 'customer'),
  ('service@example.com', 'hashed_password', 'service_rep');
  
  -- Corresponding profiles
  INSERT INTO public.user_profiles (id, role, full_name)
  SELECT id, role, 'Demo Customer'
  FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'customer@example.com';
  ```

#### Security Considerations
- No plain text password storage
- Signed JWTs prevent tampering
- RLS policies enforce data access control
- Demo accounts with limited permissions

### Next Steps
1. Create seed data for demo accounts
2. Set up database migrations for demo data
3. Implement role-based access control
4. Add proper error handling for auth edge cases
5. Implement email verification handling
6. Add password reset functionality
7. Set up SSO providers
8. Add role-specific dashboard views 

### Demo Account Implementation

#### Database Setup
- Created migration `00004_create_demo_accounts.sql` with:
  - Two demo accounts in `auth.users`:
    1. Customer: customer@example.com
    2. Service Rep: service@example.com
  - Corresponding entries in `user_profiles` with proper roles
  - Both accounts use password: Password123!
  - Used fixed UUIDs for reproducibility:
    - Customer: 00000000-0000-4000-a000-000000000001
    - Service Rep: 00000000-0000-4000-a000-000000000002
