# AI Working Notes

## Latest Changes

### Test Improvements and Fixes
- Fixed status format in ticket seeding to use snake_case consistently
- Updated e2e test files to use proper status formats and test IDs
- Improved metrics display and testing in dashboard components
- Consolidated dashboard metrics into a single component with role-based display
- Added proper error handling and logging throughout tests
- Fixed async/sync code mixing issues in test setup
- Added more resilient checks for metrics and UI elements

### Component Updates
- Merged CustomerDashboardMetrics into main DashboardMetrics component
- Added loading states and test IDs to metric cards
- Improved error handling and logging
- Added real-time subscription for metrics updates
- Added role-based metric display logic

### Test Results
- Auth tests: 6/6 passing
- Customer access: 1/1 passing
- Service rep access: 1/1 passing
- Admin access: 0/1 failing (UI visibility issue)
- Admin user management: 3/4 passing (last admin role change issue)
- Ticket creation: 0/3 failing (async/sync code issue)
- Ticket details: 0/3 failing (async/sync code issue)
- Ticket conversations: 0/1 failing (database error)

### Next Steps
1. Fix async/sync code issues in test setup
2. Address UI visibility issues in admin tests
3. Implement proper error handling for last admin role change
4. Fix database errors in ticket conversation tests
5. Add more comprehensive logging throughout the application

## Core System Patterns

### Data Model
- **User Profiles**: 
  - Roles: customer/service_rep/admin (Postgres enum)
  - Extends auth.users with profile data
  - RLS policies enforce role-based access
- **Tickets**:
  - Statuses: new/open/pending*/resolved/closed
  - Priorities: low/medium/high/urgent
  - Realtime updates via Postgres publications
- **Relationships**:
  - Tickets have customer_id (owner) and assigned_to (service rep)
  - Cascade deletes with foreign keys

### Auth Flow
- Supabase JWT with custom claims for roles
- Edge Functions for admin operations:
  - `seed-users`: Bootstrap demo data
  - `update-user-role`: Admin role management
- Session handling:
  - Client-side auth state with React Context
  - Protected routes validate roles against JWT claims

### Frontend Architecture
- **Routing**:
  - `/auth` - Public auth forms
  - `/dashboard` - Role-based layouts
  - `/tickets` - Ticket management views
- **Component Patterns**:
  - Container components handle data fetching
  - Presentational components use shadcn/ui
  - Custom hooks for Supabase subscriptions

### Testing Strategy
- **Cypress**:
  - Custom logging commands (logStep/pushToLog)
  - Test numbering system for traceability
  - Session reuse between tests
- **Key Tests**:
  - Auth flow permutations
  - Role-based access control
  - Ticket lifecycle transitions
  - Realtime update verification

## Technical Standards

### Code Quality
- **TypeScript**:
  - Strict null checks
  - GraphQL type generation
  - Supabase response typing
- **Logging**:
  - Mandatory method entry/exit logs
  - Sensitive data scrubbing
  - Centralized logger configuration

### Security
- **Backend**:
  - RLS for all Postgres tables
  - Service role keys only in Edge Functions
  - Admin operations require JWT validation
- **Frontend**:
  - Never store sensitive keys
  - Input sanitization in forms
  - Auto-complete hardening

### Realtime System
- Postgres publication for tickets/users
- Supabase channel subscriptions
- Optimistic UI updates
- Subscription cleanup on unmount

## Deployment Setup

### Supabase Config
- Migrations sequence:
  1. Core tables (users â†’ tickets)
  2. Realtime enablement
  3. Security hardening
- Edge Functions:
  - Deno runtime
  - CORS configuration
  - Environment separation (local/prod)

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Test stages:
  1. Lint (ESLint)
  2. Build (Vite)
  3. E2E (Cypress headless)
- Seed scripts:
  - Idempotent data creation
  - Environment-aware (demo vs prod)

## Pending Tasks

### High Priority
- [ ] Complete ticket lifecycle E2E test
- [ ] Implement batch role updates
- [ ] Add audit logging to edge functions

### Technical Debt
- Bundle size optimization (Vite analysis)
- Subscription memory leaks
- Flaky admin checkbox tests

## Key Decisions
1. Use Postgres enums over check constraints for better GraphQL typing
2. Implement soft deletes via status fields instead of data removal
3. Centralized error handling in Edge Functions with CORS safety
4. Client-side cache invalidation strategy using Supabase realtime
